mod.echo-fleet.description = A mod that adds a new planet, Kaltos, and its moon, Aetheria into the game.\n\n[royal[]]Kaltos[[]] is an ancient and once life blooming planet. Now ruined by eras of industrial abuse, the life became scarce and the planet is undergoing constant ice ages. It's infested with ruins of ancient factions.\n[gold[]]Aetheria[[]] on the other hand, was always a deserted, hot celestial body. Thus resulting in 2 different factions present on [royal[]]Kaltos[[]] and [gold[]]Aetheria[[]].\n\n[red[]]This mod is still in early development,[[]] as of now it only adds a bunch of [accent[]]sandbox only blocks[[]] and [accent[]]environment tiles[[]]. Several sectors have been made already, more are yet to come. It also has custom music.\n\nOther then that, the mod focuses on [accent[]]complex factories[[]] and [accent[]]refining Crude Oil[[]].\n\n[accent[]]I re-used no content from vanilla, even though this mod seemingly has several things from it.\n\n[red[]]Currently the mod is way too early into development to have any proper translations.\n\n[[]]Have fun with whats already added, I guess. :)

# Resources

# Items
item.echo-fleet-01a-01-item-scrap.name = Scrap
item.echo-fleet-01a-01-item-scrap.description = A common material composed of many different metals. It's used in general building and in unit production.

item.echo-fleet-01a-02-item-copper.name = Copper
item.echo-fleet-01a-02-item-copper.description = A soft metal with small electric charge and conductivity. Used primarily in electronics, general building, unit production and ammunition and can also be used as an ingredient for more advanced resources.

item.echo-fleet-01a-03-item-soft-coal.name = Soft Coal
item.echo-fleet-01a-03-item-soft-coal.description = A simple fuellant, acquired through refinement processes as a byproduct. Composed of mostly carbon and oxygen, it's an essential rudimentary feul due to it's flammability.

item.echo-fleet-01a-04-item-alluminum.name = Alluminum
item.echo-fleet-01a-04-item-alluminum.description = A charged, soft and light metal extracted from bauxitic ground. Rather than being mined from surface ore deposits, it's extracted from bauxitic floor. Used in building, unit production, power generation, as ammunition for turrets and also as an ingredient for advanced resourses, it's an extremely versatile metal you'll always need later on.

item.echo-fleet-01a-05-item-cupride.name = Cupride
item.echo-fleet-01a-05-item-cupride.description = A slightly charged product acquired through oxidizing copper. Cupride has an unique property that makes it able to redirect or contain gas inside it. These properties make it useful in building (especially gas-based turrets) and as corrosive and expansive ammunition.

item.echo-fleet-01a-06-item-europium.name = Europium
item.echo-fleet-01a-06-item-europium.description = A strongly charged metal, robust and slightly radioactive metal. It's robust structure requires a Blast Drill to mine. It's primarily used in building, advanced unit production and as ammunition for turrets. It's also able to be used as an ingredient for mass Neutrilizer production due to it's usually cold state when acquiring it.

item.echo-fleet-01a-07-item-polycarbonate.name = Polycarbonate
item.echo-fleet-01a-07-item-polycarbonate.description = A kind of plastic synthesized through infusing liquid petroleum gas with soft coal and letting it solidify. Used primarily in building and unit production.

item.echo-fleet-01a-08-item-sulphur.name = Sulphur
item.echo-fleet-01a-08-item-sulphur.description = A highly flammable material extracted through splitting hydrogen sulfide into hydrogen and sulfur particles and then binding the sulfur particles into a usable resource. Due to it's high flammability it's used primarily as flammable or explosive ammunition in turrets or as a fuellant.
