name: Alluminum Polycarbonate
description: A highly charged reinforced plastic. It's made through bonding Polycarbonate-bonds with Alluminum, Carbon and Ozone in differing values, smelting them and solidifying them in a specialized mold, creating this highly impact resistant and lightly flammable plastic. It's generally used in late-game building and high-tier unit production. On some occasions it can be used as high-knockback ammunition in a small variety of turrets due to its impact resistance.
