type: item
name: Echo Circuit
description: An electronic component dedicated to handling precise and complex tasks. Made by layering down Copper, Alluminum and Echo Shards and using hydrogen sulfide to carve out and shape the circuit creates better environment for the nanomachines found inside echo shards, thus, increasing their computing capabilities. It's used in building more advanced buildings, advanced unit production and as a component for making guided missles in specialized turrets.
