type: item
name: Resonance Matrix
description: An unstable and highly radioactive Alloy, fabricated through an immense reaction process. By melting massive amounts of Echo Shards and Europium, charging the melted mass with extreme amounts of electricity, soldifying it and then coating the resulting mass with Hydrogen Sulfide, you get this Alloy with its wild properties. Depending on how you use it, it can be utilized in building highly advanced structures, fabricating High-Tier units, as ammunition for late-game turrets, and even as a fuellant for a sophisticated reactor type.
