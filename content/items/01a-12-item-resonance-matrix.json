type: item
name: Resonance Matrix
description: An unstable and radioactive Alloy, fabricated through an immense creation process. By melting masses of Echo Shards and Europium, charging the melted mass with extreme amounts of electricity, soldifying it and then coating the cooled down mass with hydrogen sulfide, you get this Alloy with wild properties. Depending on how you use it, you can use it For building highly advanced structures, for fabricating High-Tier units, as ammunition for late-game turrets, aswell even using its immense radioactivity as a fuellant for a sophisticated reactor type.
