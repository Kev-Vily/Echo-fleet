type: Liquid
name: Purified Water
description: A purified version of Dirty Water, with way more heat capacity than it's Dirty counterpart. It's great heat capacity is the reason why it's used extensively on both kaltos and aetheria allowing for great cooling in buildings and turrets. It can also be used as ammunition for fluid-based turret. It also creates way less pollution than dirty water when boiled into vapor, making it use less Neutrilizer.
