description: A darkened version of regular Water exclusive to the rocky bodies of the Epsilon Boötis A system. It's unpurity is easy to spot due to its dark-ish color and composition of extreme amounts of minerals, toxic metals, and other things. It's main uses are in power generation and in early game cooling as it's still able to capacitate heat even if it's not strong. It can be purified, however, to create a better cooler.
